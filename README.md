# Pub Sub Engine

In 3rd year we had to do a team project in which Tamara Jovic and I had the task to implement I/O completion ports(IOCP) mechanism. The project was organized so that we have multiple publishers and subscribers who communicate. The communication looks like that the subscribers state which topic they want to subscribe to and the publishers publish news for the relevant topic. 
Also another task was to stress test our aplication and see heap storage. A more detailed explanation and visualisation is provided in our [documentation.](https://github.com/vesna98/PubSubEngine/blob/master/PubSubDokumentacija.pdf)
